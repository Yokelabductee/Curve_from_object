this code was created by me @yokel_abductee (on twitter) with help from chatGPT using my input and troubleshooting.

I originally wanted to track the motion path and convert it but was not successful until I asked it to track the location of the empty on each frame in a frame range from frame 1 to frame 120 which was the frame range of the file I was using as an experiment, which was the Endless engines V2 blender file created by @pwnisher a.k.a Clinton jones.

this was because I realised that people may use car rigging software that required a path to drive a vehicle, now I did create this after the deadline and winner had been anounced, but this could be handy for anyone who needs to create a path/curve object based on the location of an empty or other object over any frame range. 

IMPORTANT NOTE.

*update* I have managed to remove the errant first vertex of the curve object, next issue to tackle is resetting the curve origin to the corrected first vertex, until then it will have to be set manually.

also if you enter a frame range shorter than your scenes range it will update the scene range to the shorter number.

For example: if your scene range is 120 frames and you edit and run code for 70 frames the overall scene will now be 70 frames long so will need to readjust back to 120 frames for your scene.
