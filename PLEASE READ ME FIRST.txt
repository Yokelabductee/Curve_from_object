this code was created by me @yokel_abductee (on twitter) with help from chatGPT using my input and troubleshooting.

I originally wanted to track the motion path and convert it but was not successful until I asked it to track the location of the empty on each frame in a frame range from frame 1 to frame 120 which was the frame range of the file I was using as an experiment, which was the Endless engines V2 blender file created by @pwnisher a.k.a Clinton jones.

this was because I realised that people may use car rigging software that required a path to drive a vehicle, now I did create this after the deadline and winner had been anounced, but this could be handy for anyone who needs to create a path/curve object based on the location of an empty or other object over any frame range. 

IMPORTANT NOTE.

when this code is run it will create an extra vertex at the start of the curve object which I could not get chatGPT to help with, so you will need to manually remove the first errant vertex and reset the origin to the true first vertex.
